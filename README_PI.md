# Configuration of the Raspberry Pi

## 1.0 - Booting and Logging into the Pi

1.1 Assemble the Pi by inserting the MicroSD card, Ethernet cable, WiFi adapter, HDMI cable, input devices, and power cord into their respective jacks.

1.2 Attach the HDMI cable to a monitor, and power up the Pi.

1.3 If this is the first time to boot the Pi, a program called `raspi-config` will run. See the [documentation](http://elinux.org/RPi_raspi-config) for info on `raspi-config`. Otherwise, exit the program.

1.4 Once the Pi has finished booting, log in with the default user `pi` abd default password `raspberry`.
